# Vision

## 1. Introduction
This document will provide the vision for this project, along with a description of the end product and its purpose. In addition, this document contains an overview of the stakeholders and their involvement.

## 2. Position  

### 2.1 Business context  
A popular implementation of a monetary system without a central authority is Bitcoin which was published by Satoshi Nakamoto. To ensure the integrity of the blockchain, a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm is used. This implementation has proven to be highly secure when at least half of the network has good intentions. However, the execution of this PoW algorithm uses many resources. 

The purpose of this project is to observe and resolve the problems which occur when a monetary systems lacks a central authority. Besides these problems, a solution must be seeked as to how a monetary system can be developed without the use of excessive resources.

### 2.2 Problems  
As aforementioned, Bitcoin uses a PoW algorithm to secure the integrity of the blockchain. This is a cryptographic algorithm which ensures that every block added to the chain must be processed for an average of ten minutes. During these ten minutes, every node who choses to do so, attempts to solve the crypotgraphic problem with costs enormous amounts of resources. A study in September 2021 calculated to whole blockchain industry contributes to 0.5% of the global power usage. This is roughly the same as seven times the power usage of Google. So, Bitcoin contributes immensly to the global warming problems we are facing as a humanity.

### 2.3 Scope  
The implementation of a monetary systems will look a lot like the popular coin Bitcoin which also uses a blockchain. However, there is only large difference, our implementation will not use a PoW algorithm to secure the integrity of the chain. In addition to the lack of a PoW algorithm, other important differneces are:
* The size of the public and private keys can be 8 bits instead of the 8 bytes used in Bitcoin.
* The blockchain must only be able to handle 32 nodes within the network. However, it must be able to scale to 3.2 million if required.
* Users are not required to be kept anonymous.
* The transactions stored on the blockchain are not required to be in binary format which allows for an easier development process.

## 4. Perspective
This product is supposed to fit in the existing ecosystem of electronic devices like desktops, laptops and smartphones, in order to be accessible at any time and place which would be expected of any currency.

### 4.1 Proof of Concept
The purpose of the Proof of Concept is to prove to the stakeholders that the project is feasable. It will first be tested with a small number of nodes before development can be taken further to a growing number of nodes.

### 4.2 Acceptance
If all the defined functionality works reliably and the apps meets all requirements, this project will be considered to be a success

### 5. Product features
This chapter provides the most important product features.

Unlike bitcoin, this crypto currency will not use the Proof-of-Work algorithm but Proof-of-Stake. This is a less resource-consuming way of validating transactions and securing the network. Besides, the network needs to scalable up to a number of 3.2 million nodes, which would consume a lot of energy if it were to use the Proof-of-Work algorithm. 
In order to create a wallet the user will need to set up a node. Each node needs to keep up the ledger, the history of all transactions, in order to stay up to date and be able to validate transactions. The ledger is publicly visible to anyone plugged into the network. This way other nodes can see if their ledgers match that of others and if there are bad actors.
